## 🌟 About Me
I’m currently working as a Service Consultant at Capitec Bank while studying Software Engineering (Back‑End) through ALX.  
I learn best by doing — turning concepts into working code and documenting my progress along the way.

- 🌱 **Currently learning:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript fundamentals, Git & GitHub workflows, and command line basics.  
- 🎯 **Goal:** Become a skilled Back‑End Software Engineer.  
- 📍 **Location:** Johannesburg, South Africa.  
- 💬 **Ask me about:** My learning journey, career switch, and how I’m building my skills step‑by‑step.

## 📓 Learning in Action
I’m in the **“build and learn”** phase — focusing on small, complete projects that strengthen my fundamentals.

**Coming Soon:**
- `html-css-mini-site` — My first responsive personal bio page.  
- `javascript-practice` — Small scripts like a calculator and to‑do list.  
- `git-bash-notes` — My growing collection of Git Bash commands and tips.

## ⚡ Fun Facts
- 💃 I enjoy dancing Kizomba in my free time.  
- 🎯 I still celebrate every time I center a `div` on the first try.
